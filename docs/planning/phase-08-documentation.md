- Data model for Products/Insurances
- Observability stack and configuration

### Deliverables
- README.md at repo root (or docs/) and architecture notes

### Quality Assurance & Tests
- New developer dry-run: follow README to run and test locally; capture gaps and fix
- Lint docs (spelling/links); ensure diagrams render

### Entry Criteria

### Exit Criteria (Gate to Phase 09)
